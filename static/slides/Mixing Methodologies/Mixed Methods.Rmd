#  Plan for this session 

--

- Addressing *qualitative* vs. *quantitative* approaches 

--

- Discussing the intent of a mixed study

--

- Matching research questions to appropriate methodologies

--

- Picking the right mixed methods model or non at all

--

-  Denoting logistic constraints and considerations

But first...some light history

Well mostly light anyway

#  Contrasting paradigms:	Positivist vs. Naturalist        
- Reality is single, tangible, fragmentable , and measureable

--

- Knower and known are interactive, inseparable, and independent – e.g. with a highlevel of objectivity
time \\- and context-free generalizations are possible Big *T* *Truth*, etic preference, etc...
- There are real causes, precedent to or simultaneous with effects
- Inquiry is value-free
- Realities are multiple, socially constructed, and holistic
Knower and known are 
Only time- and context-bound generalizations are possible – truths are idiographic , emic
Impossible to distinguish causes from effects
Inquiry is value-laden
Naturalistic Inquiry by Lincoln & Guba (1985)

#  Triangulation 

By data source – multiple data collection points
By researcher – multiple researchers
By theory – multiple researchers with different theoretical perspectives
By method – multiple methods
(read Luttrell, 2005)
By verification – member checking, inquiry audit
By examination of subjectivity vu

General qualitative (vs. quantitative) orientation

#  Basic tenets 

Elements of qualitative and quantitative approaches can be combined to achieve stronger foundations for action.
Rather than focus on nature of reality or the possibility of objective truth, focus on “What are the likely consequences of believing or acting on ______?”
Pragmatic Approach (read Morgan, 2006)
Inquiries designed to understand “workability” of potential “lines of action” or basis for claims of “warranted assertions”
“Lines of Action” (George Herbert Mead)
“Workability” (both William James and John Dewey)
“Warranted assertions” (John Dewey)
![](assets/img/image1.png)

---
#  Definition and Purpose 

Mixed methodological approaches use paradigms, data sources, and/or analytic procedures from both quantitative and qualitative studies in various combinations (read Hanson, 2005).
Build on shared meanings and utilize joint action from quantitative and qualitative approaches to develop more fully warranted assertions.

“research problems in which you do not know the variables and need to explore…” versus “…specific, narrow questions to obtain measurable and observable data” (Creswell, 2005, p. 45, 47).
Focus on individual participant perspectives, attitudes, interpretations, “worlds” (Bruner, 1986).
Focus on cultural and/or social dynamics, especially as revealed and interactive with individual participant perspectives, interpretations, “worlds”.

#  A Shameless Plug 

If you end up deciding you do want/need to use mixed methods to address questions that are important to you, then you may want to try EDP 618 .
Offered every Summer during odd years .

#  More about Mixed Methodologies 

Two examples
Way et al., 1994 (Sequential Explanatory)
Idler et al., 1999 (Concurrent Triangulation)
Dimensions for mixing
Purposes for mixing
Revisiting triangulation
Truly mixed designs optimize potentials for synergy across the entire lifespan of the study, while many designs are only superficially mixed or mixed in name only 

#  Sequential Explanatory Example 

Ivankov , Creswell, and Stick (2006) began with quantitative measures assessing what variables were associated with persistence of doctoral students in an online PhD program offered by the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.
Authors identified: 
Contributing variables: Program online learning environment, student support services, faculty, and self-motivation contributed
Negligible variables: Virtual community, academic adviser, family and significant other, employment, and finances
Case study ($n$ = 4) backed up these outcomes and explained them in greater detail.

#  Concurrent Triangulation Example 

Idler, Hudson, and Leventhal (1999), working with 159 elderly African Americans, collected quantitative measures (health ratings, demographics, and medical history) and conducted qualitative interviews about the meanings of their ratings.
They initially analyzed the two data sets separately, but after coding the qualitative responses, they transformed qualitative codes into quantitative scores.
Next, they statistically analyzed the quantified qualitative results to determine if initially qualitative responses were related to quantitative ratings.

#  Purposes for mixing 

Greene, Caracelli , & Graham (1989)
A critical source for understanding the multiplicity of purposes mixed methods research is suited to address
Provides a “language” for thinking about and describing mixed methods components in your evaluation, your research (dissertation?), and in sources you review

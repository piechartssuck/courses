My voice does not sound like Morgan Freeman at all, but most pages will have some audio that will hopefully be clear enough to help you to understand a bit more about the content.

# Defining Evaluations

# Explaining it to Everyone Else 

.bg-washed.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
**Evaluation** answers ***if it works?*** and ***why does it work?***
]

We typically leave the ***if it works?*** to people with grounded knowledge in a particular area - aka *content experts*.

#  Merit, Worth & Significance 

First consider these questions
+ What do ***merit***, ***worth***,and ***significance*** mean to you both separately and combined?

+ Can you think of real world examples of each?
<br>

Now listen to these

#  Evalu… 

- *Evaluand*. This is not always as obvious to define in practice as it may seem. Where are the boundaries of a particular program? Do the evaluator, their employer, and various other stakeholders agree on those boundaries?

- *Evaluator*. Who you are matters… more on this later

#  Criteria, Standard, and Indicator 

First consider these questions

+ In addition to defining these for ourselves, what are examples from everyday?

+ Which of the three is harder to identify? Why?

#  Purposes of Evaluation – Secondary 

+ *Developmental* - To help develop an intervention or program

+ *Accountability* - To hold accountable

+ *Monitoring* - To assess implementation and gauge progress toward a desired end

+ *Knowledge Generation* - To generate knowledge about general patterns of effectiveness

+ *Ascriptive* - Merely for the sake of knowing

#  Defining Culture 

What is culture? How do we recognize it ?

“Culture can be defined as the shared experiences of people, including their languages, values, customs, beliefs, and more. It also includes worldviews, ways of knowing, and ways of communicating. Culturally significant factors encompass, but are not limited to, race/ethnicity, religion, social class, language, disability, sexual orientation, age, and gender.” (American Evaluation Association, 2011).

# Increasing your cultural sensitivity 

Try to
- Assess your own attitudes, beliefs, values
- Incorporate culturally diverse groups and perspectives throughout evaluation process
- Build in sufficient time to negotiate access and build trust in community / organization
- Demystify evaluation, avoid jargon, build buy-in
- Be flexible in choice of evaluation methods, use multiple data sources, multiple data collection methods, multiple perspectives

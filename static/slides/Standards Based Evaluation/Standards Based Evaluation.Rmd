As usual, I've tried to channel Morgan Freeman but he's having none of it. Hopefully my voice won't put you to sleep.

# Goals Include

>- Preparatory conditions
  + What does it take to be ready to target a goal? 
  + Progress toward that state is a goal.

>- Intended operations
  + What a program tries to implement to achieve a goal is a type of goal.

>- Targeted outcomes
  + Short-term (initial)
  + Medium-term (intermediate)
  + Long-term (distant)

#  How to Decide Which Goals Matter Most? 

>- Talk to stakeholders/sponsors; explicitly ask their perspective on recipient needs, program goals, and evaluation goals.

>- Figure out other ways to find needs.

>- Read all available program documentation.

>- Develop a logic model connecting needs through program activities, outputs and outcomes associated with goals.

# Logic Model Parts

+ **Inputs**. what resources go into a program (aka investments)

+ **Outputs**. what is produced through those activities
  + **Activities**. what activities the program assumes (what actually occurs)
  + **Participation**. who is part of the program and how are they served (who is served like stakeholders and sponsors and what engagement they have)

+ **Outcomes**. changes or benefits that result from the program
  + **Short**. Learning (awareness, knowledge, attitudes, skills, opinions, aspirations, motivations)
  + **Medium** *or* **Intermediate**. Action (behavior, practice, decisions, policies)
  + **Long**. Consequences (civic, economic, environmental, political, professional, social, etc.)

## Identifying Criteria 

What matters enough to measure given what you know about all the other factors? Especially,

+ Any relevant past performance data

+ Costs

+ Existing literature and standards

+ Needs and Goals

## Estimating Cost

+ Often very hard to do well

+ Almost always addressed in a relative way
  
  + Relative resource intensity of alternative programs (including development and/or retraining costs)
  + Proportion of resources allocated to different program activities (logic modeling can be very helpful for thinking about this)

## Measuring Performances

>- Sponsor perception

>- Staff performance / perception

>- Stakeholder performance / perception

<br>
In a nutshell

+ Who is best positioned to really know???

+ Multiple times, multiple perspectives

### Develop an Evaluation Purpose Statement

*Step 1*. Critique sample evaluation purpose statements (see following slides) to better understand what might go into crafting a good one.

*Step 2*. Write preliminary evaluation statement for the program you'll evaluate.

*Step 3*. Write 3 - 7 potential evaluation questions relevant to the evaluation purpose statement you wrote for step 2.

## Thinking About Evaluation Statements

In the next two slides, take a look at the sample evaluation purpose statements and *for each* try to identify:

+ What is being evaluated?

+ How will results be used?

+ What kind of evaluation (developmental, formative, or summative)?

+ How could the purpose statement be improved?

# Tips

+ Be clear

+ Be concise 

+ Be truthful

+ Get buy in

+ Be confident but **never** demeaning or overpowering

+ Don’t overpromise and underdeliver!

+ Write in a way that's meaningful to your sponsor(s)/stakeholder(s)

# And That's It

Remember that logic models may seem unnecessary but its one clear way to visually show what a program looks like before and after an evaluation. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.

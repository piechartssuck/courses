These lessons are a central part of the class—they will teach you how to use R and corresponding packages we’ll use.\nInteractive training sections are provided on Data Camp1.\n    Purpose The ultimate point of Data Camp is to get you familiarized with an environment that you likely have never seen or been exposed to. While you should absolutely go through each module, there is certainly no expectation that you will get everything right. In fact, the points that you incur don’t mean anything as far as how you are assessed so please use hints as needed! As with any things data science, you’ll learn by doing. If you are a polar personality type when it comes to work (i.e. primarily a perfectionist or mostly careless), then the modules will likely prove to be a challenge. It is highly unlikely that you will be able to comprehend everything by going beyond your limit or that it will just come to you so please work hard but also take breaks, swear2, and ask peers or me for help.\n Grading The emphasis on Data Camp involves putting in a solid effort, rather than completing everything correctly. The earned grade distribution is as follows:\n 115%: Modules are 100% completed. Every task was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. These are not earned often. 100%: Modules are 70–99% complete and most answers are correct or on point. This is the expected level of performance. 50%: Modules are less than 70% complete and/or most answers are incorrect or off-point. This indicates that you need to improve next time. Hopefully people will not earn this often.  Otherwise 0%.\n Notes for previous participants If you have participated in Data Camp before and would like to receive credit for assigned modules you have previously completed, make sure to login with the associated username. Please note that you must do this to qualify.\n for new participants Please take your time going through these, especially the initial module. I suggest setting 8-10 hours aside spread the information out over the next two weeks if it is conducive to your learning style. This first module gives you an understand of the R environment. Please reach out if you need help!\n  Installing R and RStudio Go to the Installing R, RStudio, and tidyverse page under Resources to get both R and RStudio installed on your system.\nData Camp Schedule A growing schedule is given below.

These must be turned in by Wednesday at 11:59 PM on the ecampus Submission Portal.\n Meetings Starting after the fourth week, we will need to meet on a biweekly basis to discuss project parameters and to give you an opportunity to ask questions.

Your task is simply to go through these.\nI will grade these short excercises using a check system:\n ✔+: (11.5 points (115%) in gradebook) Modules are 100% completed.

Again, I am not grading your coding ability, checking each line of code or syntax to make sure it produces the exact output, and most importantly, I am not looking for perfection! Try hard, get frustrated, do good work and you’ll get a ✓ or even a ✔+.\nI encourage you to work together on the courses if possible, but you must turn in your own work on eCampus.\nOtherwise 0 points (0%) in gradebook.\n Final Task At the end of the course, you will demonstrate your data visualization skills by completing a final task.\nComplete details for this will be posted here at a later date.

I hated them as a graduate student and still hate them as a professor. I recently made the decision to never use discussion board posts again for many reasons which are not useful to discuss here.\nI always prefer face to face or at least conferencing if needed.

Note that you do not have to use your WVU account, but its not a bad idea. Head to to the channel #introduce-yourself and well introduce yourself by tell everyone about yourself, what you hope to achieve out of this course, and something about you that really defines who you are. For example, here is something about me:\nI teach data visualization BUT I am also about 40% colorblind1\n (optional) Provide a picture if you are willing. I am a very visual person as are many other people so pictures help a great deal. However, you are not mandated to do so!   Software with a Choice Decide whether to sign up for RStudio.cloud or install a local copy.\n  Postings People who conduct social network analysis (SNA) are often tasked to describe complex methodologies applied to highly connected data and any corresponding results in layman’s terms. This is further compounded by the idea that networks are neither quantitative nor quantitative by design which makes it fairly unique. In fact, to steal a term from Physics, a given network constructed only of data is in methodological superposition, in that until a measurement is taken it is both quantitative and qualitative at the same time and we don’t have to consider if a cat is alive or dead or both. However unlike physics we can get information about both.2\nIn the spirit of visualizations, the purpose of constructing social networks is to picture the complexity of relationships and to convey information about measures taken on those relationships. And that brings us to your first task:\nPlease create a computer generated or a hand drawn image of the purpose(s) of social network analysis without using any additional explanation or descriptions3 and post it on Slack on the #pictures-of-sna channel.\nWhile there are no right or wrong answers here, submissions that are able to describing the purpose(s) of SNAs visually will earn additional extra credit points that can be used on anything except the final exam. So please try to be creative, put some thought into it and maybe you’ll start the term off with up to five (5) extra credit points! When is the last tine you started a class in the blue, if ever?\n  You just need to know a little math to distinguish colors without ever seeing them↩︎\n Here’s an example that makes me feel old. Remember sentence diagrams? The outcomes from these are social networks and variants now form a basis for many text mining approaches. We’ll actually explore some of these later in the term.↩︎\n You can label the network itself with text, but please keep it to a minimum.↩︎\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"cd68d33fd695c4cb530e5382816aaaff","permalink":"https://edp693g.asocialdatascientist.com/tasks/01-tasks/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tasks/01-tasks/","section":"tasks","summary":".hvr-sweep-to-left { display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle; -webkit-transform: perspective(1px) translateZ(0); transform: perspective(1px) translateZ(0); box-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); position: relative; -webkit-transition-property: color; transition-property: color; -webkit-transition-duration: 0.","tags":null,"title":"The Basics","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   Accessibility Colors Fonts Graphic assets  Images Vectors Vectors, photos, videos, and other assets    Accessibility  Color Oracle: Simulate how your images look for people with different forms of colorblindness (desktop-based, more types of colorblindness) Vischeck: Simulate how your images look for people with different forms of colorblindness (web-based)   Colors  Adobe Color: Create, share, and explore rule-based and custom color palettes.

We will have a shared class workspace in RStudio.cloud that will let you quickly copy templates for labs and problem sets.\nGo to https://rstudio.cloud/ and create an account. You’ll receive a link to join the shared class workspace separately. If you don’t get this link, let me know and I will invite you.\n RStudio on your computer RStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets, more complicated analysis, or fancier graphics. Over the course of the semester, you should wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud and install all these things locally. This is also important if you want to customize fonts, since RStudio.cloud has extremely limited support for fonts other than Helvetica.\nHere’s how you install all these things\nInstall R First you need to install R itself (the engine).\nGo to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network)1 website: https://cran.r-project.org/\n Click on “Download R for XXX”, where XXX is either Mac or Windows:\n If you use macOS, scroll down to the first .pkg file in the list of files (as of this writing, it’s R-4.0.0.pkg; as of right now but download the most current version.\n If you use Windows, click “base” (or click on the bolded “install R for the first time” link) and download it.\n  Double click on the downloaded file (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n If you use macOS, download and install XQuartz. You do not need to do this on Windows.\n   Install RStudio Next, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won’t ever have to interact with it directly.\nGo to the free download location on RStudio’s website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\n The website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it:\nIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\n Double click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n  Double click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n Install tidyverse R packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on “Install,” type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.\nThis can sometimes be tedious when you’re installing lots of packages, though. The tidyverse, for instance, consists of dozens of packages (including ggplot2) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nGo to the packages panel in RStudio, click on “Install,” type “tidyverse”, and press enter. You’ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed.\nNotice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.\n   It’s a goofy name, but CRAN is where most R packages—and R itself—lives.↩︎\n   ","date":1594771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594771200,"objectID":"efb59c0882a965443ffcbafa3cd27ca6","permalink":"https://edp693g.asocialdatascientist.com/resource/install/","publishdate":"2020-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resource/install/","section":"resource","summary":"RStudio.cloud RStudio on your computer  Install R Install RStudio Install tidyverse    You will do all of your work in this class with the open source (and free!","tags":null,"title":"Installing R, RStudio, and tidyverse","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   RStudio.cloud RStudio on your computer  Install R Install RStudio Install tidyverse    You will do all of your work in this class with the open source (and free!) programming language R.

There are like a billion little options and features available for math equations—you can find helpful examples of the the most common basic commands here.\nYou can use math in two different ways: inline or in a display block. To use math inline, wrap it in single dollar signs, like $y = mx + b$:\n    Type… …to get    Based on the DAG, the regression model for estimating the effect of education on wages is $\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\epsilon$, or $\\text{Wages} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{Education} + \\epsilon$. Based on the DAG, the regression model for estimating the effect of education on wages is \\(\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\epsilon\\), or \\(\\text{Wages} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{Education} + \\epsilon\\).    To put an equation on its own line in a display block, wrap it in double dollar signs, like this:\nType…\nThe quadratic equation was an important part of high school math: $$ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$ But now we just use computers to solve for $x$. …to get…\n The quadratic equation was an important part of high school math:\n\\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\nBut now we just use computers to solve for \\(x\\).\n Because dollar signs are used to indicate math equations, you can’t just use dollar signs like normal if you’re writing about actual dollars. For instance, if you write This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40, Markdown will treat everything that comes between the dollar signs as math, like so: “This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40”.\nTo get around that, put a backslash (\\) in front of the dollar signs, so that This book costs \\$5.75 and this other costs \\$40 becomes “This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40”.\n Tables There are 4 different ways to hand-create tables in Markdown—I say “hand-create” because it’s normally way easier to use R to generate these things with packages like pander (use pandoc.table()) or knitr (use kable()). The two most common are simple tables and pipe tables. You should look at the full documentation here.\nFor simple tables, type…\n Right Left Center Default ------- ------ ---------- ------- 12 12 12 12 123 123 123 123 1 1 1 1 Table: Caption goes here …to get…\n Caption goes here  Right Left Center Default    12 12 12 12  123 123 123 123  1 1 1 1    For pipe tables, type…\n| Right | Left | Default | Center | |------:|:-----|---------|:------:| | 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 | | 123 | 123 | 123 | 123 | | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | Table: Caption goes here …to get…\n Caption goes here  Right Left Default Center    12 12 12 12  123 123 123 123  1 1 1 1     Footnotes There are two different ways to add footnotes (see here for complete documentation): regular and inline.\nRegular notes need (1) an identifier and (2) the actual note. The identifier can be whatever you want. Some people like to use numbers like [^1], but if you ever rearrange paragraphs or add notes before #1, the numbering will be wrong (in your Markdown file, not in the output; everything will be correct in the output). Because of that, I prefer to use some sort of text label:\nType…\nHere is a footnote reference[^1] and here is another [^note-on-dags]. [^1]: This is a note. [^note-on-dags]: DAGs are neat. And here\u0026#39;s more of the document. …to get…\n Here is a footnote reference1 and here is another.2\nAnd here’s more of the document.\n  This is a note.↩︎   DAGs are neat.↩︎     You can also use inline footnotes with ^[Text of the note goes here], which are often easier because you don’t need to worry about identifiers:\nType…\nCausal inference is neat.^[But it can be hard too!] …to get…\n Causal inference is neat.1\n  But it can be hard too!↩︎      Front matter You can include a special section at the top of a Markdown document that contains metadata (or data about your document) like the title, date, author, etc. This section uses a special simple syntax named YAML (or “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”) that follows this basic outline: setting: value for setting. Here’s an example YAML metadata section. Note that it must start and end with three dashes (---).\n--- title: Title of your document date: \u0026quot;January 13, 2020\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;Your name\u0026quot; --- You can put the values inside quotes (like the date and name in the example above), or you can leave them outside of quotes (like the title in the example above). I typically use quotes just to be safe—if the value you’re using has a colon (:) in it, it’ll confuse Markdown since it’ll be something like title: My cool title: a subtitle, which has two colons. It’s better to do this:\n--- title: \u0026quot;My cool title: a subtitle\u0026quot; --- If you want to use quotes inside one of the values (e.g. your document is An evaluation of \"scare quotes\"), you can use single quotes instead:\n--- title: \u0026#39;An evaluation of \u0026quot;scare quotes\u0026quot;\u0026#39; ---  Citations One of the most powerful features of Markdown + pandoc is the ability to automatically cite things and generate bibliographies. to use citations, you need to create a BibTeX file (ends in .bib) that contains a database of the things you want to cite. You can do this with bibliography managers designed to work with BibTeX directly (like BibDesk on macOS), or you can use Zotero (macOS and Windows) to export a .bib file. You can download an example .bib file of all the readings from this class here.\nComplete details for using citations can be found here. In brief, you need to do three things:\nAdd a bibliography: entry to the YAML metadata:\n--- title: Title of your document date: \u0026quot;January 13, 2020\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;Your name\u0026quot; bibliography: name_of_file.bib --- Choose a citation style based on a CSL file. The default is Chicago author-date, but you can choose from 2,000+ at this repository. Download the CSL file, put it in your project folder, and add an entry to the YAML metadata (or provide a URL to the online version):\n--- title: Title of your document date: \u0026quot;January 13, 2020\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;Your name\u0026quot; bibliography: name_of_file.bib csl: \u0026quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/apa.csl\u0026quot; --- Some of the most common CSLs are:\n Chicago author-date Chicago note-bibliography Chicago full note-bibliography (no shortened notes or ibids){target=\"_blank\"} APA 7th edition MLA 8th edition  Cite things in your document. Check the documentation for full details of how to do this. Essentially, you use @citationkey inside square brackets ([]):\n    Type… …to get…    Causal inference is neat [@Rohrer:2018; @AngristPischke:2015].

You can do everything you can with regular Markdown, but you can incorporate graphs, tables, and other R output directly in your document. You can create HTML, PDF, and Word documents, PowerPoint and HTML presentations, websites, books, and even interactive dashboards with R Markdown. This whole course website is created with R Markdown (and a package named blogdown).\nThe documentation for R Markdown is extremely comprehensive, and their tutorials and cheatsheets are excellent—rely on those.\nHere are the most important things you’ll need to know about R Markdown in this class:\nKey terms  Document: A Markdown file where you type stuff\n Chunk: A piece of R code that is included in your document. It looks like this:\n```{r} # Code goes here ``` There must be an empty line before and after the chunk. The final three backticks must be the only thing on the line—if you add more text, or if you forget to add the backticks, or accidentally delete the backticks, your document will not knit correctly.\n Knit: When you “knit” a document, R runs each of the chunks sequentially and converts the output of each chunk into Markdown. R then runs the knitted document through pandoc to convert it to HTML or PDF or Word (or whatever output you’ve selected).\nYou can knit by clicking on the “Knit” button at the top of the editor window, or by pressing ⌘⇧K on macOS or control + shift + K on Windows.\n   Add chunks There are three ways to insert chunks:\n Press ⌘⌥I on macOS or control + alt + I on Windows\n Click on the “Insert” button at the top of the editor window\n Manually type all the backticks and curly braces (don’t do this)\n   Chunk names You can add names to chunks to make it easier to navigate your document. If you click on the little dropdown menu at the bottom of your editor in RStudio, you can see a table of contents that shows all the headings and chunks. If you name chunks, they’ll appear in the list. If you don’t include a name, the chunk will still show up, but you won’t know what it does.\nTo add a name, include it immediately after the {r in the first line of the chunk. Names cannot contain spaces, but they can contain underscores and dashes. All chunk names in your document must be unique.\n```{r name-of-this-chunk} # Code goes here ```  Chunk options There are a bunch of different options you can set for each chunk. You can see a complete list in the RMarkdown Reference Guide or at knitr’s website.\nOptions go inside the {r} section of the chunk:\n```{r name-of-this-chunk, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE} # Code goes here ``` The most common chunk options are these:\n fig.width=5 and fig.height=3 (or whatever number you want): Set the dimensions for figures echo=FALSE: The code is not shown in the final document, but the results are message=FALSE: Any messages that R generates (like all the notes that appear after you load a package) are omitted warning=FALSE: Any warnings that R generates are omitted include=FALSE: The chunk still runs, but the code and results are not included in the final document  You can also set chunk options by clicking on the little gear icon in the top right corner of any chunk:\n Inline chunks You can also include R output directly in your text, which is really helpful if you want to report numbers from your analysis. To do this, use `r r_code_here`.\nIt’s generally easiest to calculate numbers in a regular chunk beforehand and then use an inline chunk to display the value in your text. For instance, this document…\n```{r find-avg-mpg, echo=FALSE} avg_mpg \u0026lt;- mean(mtcars$mpg) ``` The average fuel efficiency for cars from 1974 was `r round(avg_mpg, 1)` miles per gallon. … would knit into this:\n The average fuel efficiency for cars from 1974 was 20.1 miles per gallon.\n  Output formats You can specify what kind of document you create when you knit in the YAML front matter.\ntitle: \u0026quot;My document\u0026quot; output: html_document: default pdf_document: default word_document: default You can also click on the down arrow on the “Knit” button to choose the output and generate the appropriate YAML. If you click on the gear icon next to the “Knit” button and choose “Output options”, you change settings for each specific output type, like default figure dimensions or whether or not a table of contents is included.\nThe first output type listed under output: will be what is generated when you click on the “Knit” button or press the keyboard shortcut (⌘⇧K on macOS; control + shift + K on Windows). If you choose a different output with the “Knit” button menu, that output will be moved to the top of the output section.\nThe indentation of the YAML section matters, especially when you have settings nested under each output type.

All of these things will do exactly the same thing:\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty\u0026gt;10, class==\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) filter(mpg,cty\u0026gt;10,class==\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) filter ( mpg,cty\u0026gt;10, class==\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot; ) But you’ll notice that only a few of those iterations (the first three) are easily readable.\nTo help improve readability and make it easier to share code with others, there’s an unofficial style guide for writing R code. It’s fairly short and just has lots of examples of good and bad ways of writing code (naming variables, dealing with long lines, using proper indentation levels, etc.)—you should glance through it some time.\nRStudio has a built-in way of cleaning up your code. Select some code, press ctrl + i (on Windows) or ⌘ + i (on macOS), and R will reformat the code for you. It’s not always perfect, but it’s really helpful for getting indentation right without having to manually hit space a billion times.\n Main style things to pay attention to for this class  Important note: I won’t ever grade you on any of this! If you submit something like filter(mpg,cty\u0026gt;10,class==\"compact\"), I might recommend adding spaces, but it won’t affect your grade or points or anything.\n Spacing  See the “Spacing” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n Put spaces after commas (like in regular English):\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter(mpg , cty \u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg ,cty \u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg,cty \u0026gt; 10) Put spaces around operators like +, -, \u0026gt;, =, etc.:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter(mpg, cty\u0026gt;10) filter(mpg, cty\u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt;10) Don’t put spaces around parentheses that are parts of functions:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter (mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) filter ( mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) filter( mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10 )  Long lines  See the “Long lines” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n It’s generally good practice to not have really long lines of code. A good suggestion is to keep lines at a maximum of 80 characters. Instead of counting characters by hand (ew), in RStudio go to “Tools” \u0026gt; “Global Options” \u0026gt; “Code” \u0026gt; “Display” and check the box for “Show margin”. You should now see a really thin line indicating 80 characters. Again, you can go beyond this—that’s fine. It’s just good practice to avoid going too far past it.\nYou can add line breaks inside longer lines of code. Line breaks should come after commas, and things like function arguments should align within the function:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) # Bad filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class %in% c(\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pickup\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;midsize\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;subcompact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;suv\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2seater\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;minivan\u0026quot;)) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class %in% c(\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pickup\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;midsize\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;subcompact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;suv\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2seater\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;minivan\u0026quot;))  Pipes (%\u0026gt;%) and ggplot layers (+) Put each layer of a ggplot plot on separate lines, with the + at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n# Good ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Bad ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Super bad ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Super bad and won\u0026#39;t even work ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() Put each step in a dplyr pipeline on separate lines, with the %\u0026gt;% at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n# Good mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Bad mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Super bad mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Super bad and won\u0026#39;t even work mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))  Comments  See the “Comments” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n Comments should start with a comment symbol and a single space: #\n# Good #Bad #Bad If the comment is really short (and won’t cause you to go over 80 characters in the line), you can include it in the same line as the code, separated by at least two spaces (it works with one space, but using a couple can enhance readability):\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% # Only rows where cty is 10 + group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% # Divide into class groups summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Find the average hwy in each group You can add extra spaces to get inline comments to align, if you want:\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% # Only rows where cty is 10 + group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% # Divide into class groups summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Find the average hwy in each group If the comment is really long, you can break it into multiple lines. RStudio can do this for you if you go to “Code” \u0026gt; “Reflow comment”\n# Good # Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. # Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys’ house.

When you unzip a zipped file, your operating system extracts all the files that are contained inside into a new folder on your computer.\nUnzipping files on macOS is trivial, but unzipping files on Windows can mess you up if you don’t pay careful attention. Here’s a helpful guide to unzipping files on both macOS and Windows.\nUnzipping files on macOS Double click on the downloaded .zip file. macOS will automatically create a new folder with the same name as the .zip file, and all the file’s contents will be inside. Double click on the RStudio Project file (.Rproj) to get started.\n Unzipping files on Windows tl;dr: Right click on the .zip file, select “Extract All…”, and work with the resulting unzipped folder.\nUnlike macOS, Windows does not automatically unzip things for you. If you double click on the .zip file, Windows will show you what’s inside, but it will do so without actually extracting anything. This can be is incredibly confusing! Here’s what it looks like—the only clues that this folder is really a .zip file are that there’s a “Compressed Folder Tools” tab at the top, and there’s a “Ratio” column that shows how much each file is compressed.\nIt is very tempting to try to open files from this view. However, if you do, things will break and you won’t be able to correctly work with any of the files in the zipped folder. If you open the R Project file, for instance, RStudio will point to a bizarre working directory buried deep in some temporary folder:\nYou most likely won’t be able to open any data files or save anything, which will be frustrating.\nInstead, you need to right click on the .zip file and select “Extract All…”:\nThen choose where you want to unzip all the files and click on “Extract”\nYou should then finally have a real folder with all the contents of the zipped file. Open the R Project file and RStudio will point to the correct working directory and everything will work.\n ","date":1588723200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588723200,"objectID":"c14c352fd4c4ab8c12a3cd60b30b9d8c","permalink":"https://edp693g.asocialdatascientist.com/resource/unzipping/","publishdate":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resource/unzipping/","section":"resource","summary":"Because RStudio projects typically consist of multiple files (R scripts, datasets, graphical output, etc.) the easiest way to distribute them to you for examples, assignments, and projects is to combine all the different files in to a single compressed collection called a zip file.","tags":null,"title":"Unzipping files","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   This is me This is what I am This is where I come from This is what I research This is how you can contact me This is Sparta   This is me     This is what I am Professor of Educational Psychology and coordinator of the Program Evaluation Certificate at WVU.\n This is where I come from  PhD in Program Evaluation from Western Michigan University.

Response times are typically much quicker than the standard 24-48 hours given to emails. Please remember that life is still chaotic at this time!\n  Course objectives  FAQ Is the course content difficult? You’ve probably heard an answer like this before: At times some of the material can be dense. Well that isn’t much of a response. Difficulty is not the issue here since as humans with differing educational background, we will have strengths in some areas more than others. Instead the question is can you identify areas that need strengthened and communicate them? If you can, then you have a good shot at succeeding in this class.\n Is R difficult? Learning R can be especially challenging at first—it’s akin to learning a new language like Spanish or even mathematics. Even experienced R users get frustrated…and so much so that some of us have swear jars. However as silly as it sounds one of the best feelings is to overcome a roadblock. With that said, if you find yourself getting irritated, try the following: take a break, go let some frustration out, sleep, discuss with a peer, etc. If you are at your limit, take a few breaths and contact me!\n What if I find a mistake? Tell me! I strive to be error free but like everyone else, make silly mistakes. This includes grammar and spelling errors as well!\n  Course materials There is XXXX text and two software packages necessary for this course.\nBooks, articles, and other materials We’ll rely on the texts below:\n Authors (YEAR). Book (XXXX ed.). SAGE.\n American Psychological Association. (2020). Publication manual of the American Psychological Association (7th ed.).\n  There will occasionally be additional articles and videos to read and watch. When this happens, links to these other resources will be included on the content page for that session.\nSubscribing to the R Weekly newsletter provides many helpful tutorials about how to do R. This certainly is not a requirement.\n R and RStudio You will do all of your analysis with the open source (and free!) programming language R. You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations produces the actual statistics and graphical output, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code. Please note that\nyou do not need to have any programming experience to use R\nR is free, but it can sometimes be a task to install and configure. To make life easier, you can opt to use the free RStudio.cloud service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This is recommended for those of you who do not want to install programs right now but please note that you will most likely have to in the near future.\nThe service is convenient, but please keep in mind that it can be slow and is not designed to handle large data sets or more complicated analysis and graphics. You also cannot customize much with RStudio.cloud. Over the course of the term, you’ll want to get around to installing R, RStudio, and other R packages on your computer and wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud.\nYou can find instructions for installing R, RStudio, and all the tidyverse packages here.\n Online help Data science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and little errors in your commands can cause hours of headache. People working in any syntax based software package at any level experience this!\nFortunately there are many online resources to help. Two of the most important are StackOverflow (a Q\u0026amp;A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and RStudio Community (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)). I freely admit that StackOverflow has saved me multiple hours of frustration.\nIf you use Twitter, post R-related questions and content with #rstats. The community there is exceptionally generous and helpful.\nSearching for help with R on Google (or another indexed search site) can sometimes be tricky because the program name is,for a lack of a better explanation, a single letter.\nYou can email me with questions about content or R (after giving it an effort of course). Please include the subject header EDP XXX “the title of your email” where the title of your email is given without the quotes. I have a mail filter that will automatically bring your email to a top priority status. In this new normal, I receive an overwhelming number of emails per day and may miss yours if the header is not formatted properly.\nFinally, we have a class chatroom at Slack where you can poise a question. I will monitor Slack regularly and will respond quickly. (This is a rare Slack work space where I readily keep notifications on!) Ask questions about the readings, exercises, and mini projects. You’ll likely have similar questions as your peers, and you’ll likely be able to answer other peoples’ questions too.\n  Assignments and grades You can find descriptions for all the assignments on the assignments page.\n   Assignment Points Percent    Things (6 × 20) 120 24%  Other Things (6 × 20) 120 24%  Project Thing 1 60 12%  Project Thing 2 60 12%  Final Thing Project 140 28%  Total 500 —        Grade Range    A 90–100%  B 80%-89%  C 70–79%  D 60–69%  F \u0026lt; 60%     Your hours Please watch this video:\n Your hours (formerly known as office hours) are set times dedicated to you the student!1). This means that I will be in my office at home waiting for you to come by talk to me remotely with whatever questions you have. This is the best and easiest way to find me and the best chance for discussing class material and concerns.\nBecause of the pandemic, we cannot meet in person. I can meet you online via Zoom. You can request a meeting through either e-mail or Slack.\n Class conduct and expectations Here are the rules, expectations, and policies that I came up or stole from other professors:\n Late work: Barring the final project, past due deliverables will only be accepted up to 48 hours after the initial time and due date. For each full day an assignment is late, 10% of the final grade will be deducted. All submissions must be made via eCampus. There are no exceptions to this policy. Please note that I will not accept coursework by email or any other means. Participation: Please ensure that you are engaged and participate in class. Engagement is mostly defined by you—if that means commenting and answering questions, neat; if it means sitting quietly and being focused, also neat; but if it means being being disrespectful or flaking off, not so neat. Rubrics: While there are valid reasons for the utilization of a rubric in undergraduate classes, at the graduate level, I do not (often) provide nor use a such an item to guide or evaluate your submission due to four primary concerns:  When writing anything in academia that is pivotal (a thesis, dissertation, journal article, report, etc.), there is (typically) no such document as a rubric. If you write within the limitations as defined in a rubric, then creativity may be stifled (i.e. writing to the rubric rather than constructing a product from the ground up). Feedback can only be given along the criteria listed within a rubric which limits your learning as a student and constrains me as the instructor. Unless you are in a very specific area, the real world does not use rubrics!   Technology use: Use phones, computers, etc. responsibly. You’re all adults…well I am most of the time.   Learning during a pandemic There’s really no other way to say it - life sucks right now!\nYou probably know people who have lost their jobs, tested positive for COVID-19, been hospitalized, or have even died. Additionally your work responsibilities have most likely shifted, coming with it added stress and worries. Please take note of the following:\nI am fully committed to making sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class!\nI will make whatever reasonable and feasible accommodations I can to help you learn the course material, finish your tasks, and to understand what areas you may need to concentrate on. Under pandemic conditions, I am flexible and lenient with grading and course expectations when students face difficult challenges provided that you keep an open line of communication! Furthermore, if you feel like you are behind or not understanding everything, do not suffer in silence! Please talk to me!\nI selfishly want you to learn lots of things from this class (design! analysis! R! creating visualizations!, proving that \\(0.99999\\ldots = 1\\) - ok maybe not that last one but its true!). With all of that said, I first want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.\n  Course policies Its pretty simple: Be nice. Be honest. Don’t cheat. Be a good human.\nWe will also follow WVU’s Code of Conduct.\nThis syllabus reflects a plan for the term. Deviations may become necessary as the course progresses. Note that I reserve the right to alter or amend this syllabus. I will send notifications if course tasks are affected.\n COVID-19 Statement WVU is committed to maintaining a safe learning environment for all students, faculty, and staff. Should campus operations change because of health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that this course will move to a fully online delivery format. If that occurs, students will be advised of technical and/or equipment requirements, including remote proctoring software.\nIn a face-to-face environment, our commitment to safety requires students, staff, and instructors to observe the social distancing and personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines set by the University at all times. While in class, students will sit in assigned seats when applicable and wear the required PPE. Should a student forget to bring the required PPE, PPE will be available in the building for students to acquire. Students who fail to comply will be dismissed from the classroom for the class period and may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for further sanctions.\nIf a student becomes sick or is required to quarantine during the semester, they should notify the instructor. The student should work with the instructor to develop a plan to receive the necessary course content, activities, and assessments to complete the course learning outcomes.\nPsychological and Psychiatric Services Life at WVU can be complicated and challenging, especially during a pandemic! You might feel overwhelmed, experience anxiety or depression, or struggle with relationships or family responsibilities. Psychological and Psychiatric Services provides free, confidential support for students who are struggling with mental health and emotional challenges. The office is staffed by professional counselors and psychiatrists who are attuned to the needs of all types of college and professional students. Please do not hesitate to contact them for assistance—getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do.\n CARE Team If you or anyone you know may be at-risk such as those listed here, please make a CARE referral. You may do so directly at the main WVU CARE TEAM site.\n Lauren’s Promise I will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you.\nLauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student athlete, was murdered on October 22, 2018 by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus. We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again.\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911 or the Campus Police at 304-293-3136.\nIf you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me and I will connect you to resources or call/text a private Title IX On-Call Line (304-906-9930).\nAny form of sexual harassment or violence will not be excused or tolerated at West Virginia University. WVU has instituted procedures to respond to violations of these laws and standards, programs aimed at the prevention of such conduct, and intervention on behalf of the victims.\n Academic Integrity The integrity of the classes offered by any academic institution solidifies the foundation of its mission and cannot be sacrificed to expediency, ignorance, or blatant fraud. Therefore, I will enforce rigorous standards of academic integrity in all aspects and assignments of this course. For the detailed policy of West Virginia University regarding the definitions of acts considered to fall under academic dishonesty and possible ensuing sanctions, please see the West Virginia University Academic Catalog at http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext. Should you have any questions about possibly improper research citations or references, or any other activity that may be interpreted as an attempt at academic dishonesty, please see me before the assignment is due to discuss the matter.\n Inclusivity Statement The West Virginia University community is committed to creating and fostering a positive learning and working environment based on open communication, mutual respect, and inclusion.\nIf you are a person with a disability and anticipate needing any type of accommodation in order to participate in this class, please advise me and make appropriate arrangements with the Office of Accessibility Services (293-6700).\nFor more information on West Virginia University’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives, please see http://diversity.wvu.edu.\n Incomplete Grades Students who want to be considered for an Incomplete must apply to their instructor prior to the end of the term. If the instructor agrees, the instructor and the student must negotiate the conditions under which the grade of I will be changed to a letter grade and sign a contract. The date to submit the incomplete work should not be set beyond the last day of class of the following semester. If the student does not complete the terms of contract, then the instructor should submit a grade of F. All incomplete contracts must be filed with the department and Dean’s Office.

Please review the sharing and editing restrictions prior to distributing or amending any material on this site. As such, the unauthorized purchase or sale of these materials may result in disciplinary sanctions under the Campus Student Code.\n Student Evaluation of Instruction (SEI) Effective teaching is a primary mission of West Virginia University. Student evaluation of instruction provides the university and the instructor with feedback about your experiences in the course for review and course improvement. Your participation in the evaluation of course instruction is both strongly encouraged and highly valued. Results are strictly confidential, anonymous, and not available to the instructor until after final grades are released by Admissions and Records. Information about how you can complete this evaluation will be provided later.\n University Attendance Policy At West Virginia University, class attendance contributes significantly to academic success. Students who attend classes regularly tend to earn higher grades and have higher passing rates in courses. Excessive absences may jeopardize students’ grades or even their ability to continue in their courses. There is a strong correlation between regular class attendance and academic success.\n Course Netiquette The basic premise is that the etiquette expected of students in the online environment is the same as that expected in a classroom. Common courtesy is the guiding rule of Internet communications. Be prepared to communicate effectively when taking an online course. Following these simple netiquette rules in your online class or education environment will ensure your success:\n Include a professional salutation. In this case, “Hello Dr. Roy” or “Dear Dr. Roy” is appropriate. Include a proper ending such as “Thank you” or “With regards.” Then type in your full name. Never type in ALL CAPS, because it reads as if you ARE SHOUTING AT PEOPLE. Act as professionally, via your writing, as you would in a face to face classroom. Refrain from inappropriate language and derogatory or personal attacks. Do not dominate any discussion. Give other students the opportunity to join in the discussion. Disagree with ideas but avoid challenges that may be interpreted as a personal attack. Check that you are replying to the specific person you intend, and not to the entire class. Never give your password to another person. Respect the virtual classroom. Never forward in-class communications or posts by others outside of this virtual space. Never spam your classmates. If you quote someone’s previous post, only quote enough to make your point.  Be aware of the University’s Academic Integrity and Dishonesty Policy http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext. You can review the rules, regulations, and procedures concerning student conduct and discipline for the main campus of West Virginia University, at http://campuslife.wvu.edu/r/download/1802350.\n Response Time I generally respond to Slack queries in the same day while responses to emails and discussion posts are within 48 hours, except during holidays. Often, I will reply much more quickly but you should not count on a immediate. Please plan accordingly so that you don’t miss deadlines! I generally return assignments within one to two weeks after a final submission date.\n Technical Requirements Students need to have access to a computer for word processing, e-mail and access to eCampus.

For some reason that is not clear, particular graduate students have noted in my course evaluations that they believe these to be the times I should not be disturbed.

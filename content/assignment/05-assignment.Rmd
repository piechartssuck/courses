# What to Do: Replicate Using `ggplot`

In this task, you are asked to do three things:

-   Pick **one** of the Plots given in the tabs.

-   Replicate a **static version** of it using `ggplot2`

-   Produce **one alternative visualization** using the same dataset in `ggplot2`

## Visualization Choices 

### Choice 1: Government Data
This graphic was published in the [New York Times](https://archive.nytimes.com/screenshots/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/11/23/us/state-government-control-since-1938.jpg){target="\_blank"} back in 2012. You are tasked to replicate and construct an alternative for it.

![](/assignment/05-assignment_files/Choice1.png)

Download the [visual](/visuals/Choice1.png)

Download the data set [`divided.csv`](/data/divided.csv) to construct this visualization.

### Choice 2: Surface Temperatures

You are looking at the surface temperature Dec 2001 on a very coarse 24 by 24 grid covering Central America. You are tasked to replicate and construct an alternative for it (Hint: use `geom_tile()`)

![](/assignment/05-assignment_files/Choice2.png)

[Download the visual](/visuals/Choice2.png){width=70%}

To get the data, run the following in your script and Rmarkdown document:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("nasaweather")

library(nasaweather)

jan2001 <- subset(atmos, year == 2000 & month == 1)
```


### Choice 3: Average Temperatures

This data set for the following plot includes the average mean, minimum, and maximum daily temperature in Corvallis, Oregon based on a ten year span. You are tasked to replicate and construct an alternative for it: (Hint: use `geom_pointrange()`)

![](/assignment/05-assignment_files/Choice3.png)

Download the [visual](/visuals/Choice3.png)

Download the data set [`corv.csv`](/data/corv.csv) to construct this visualization.

### Choice 4: Baseball

This graphic was published in the [New York Times](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/03/29/sports/baseball/Strikeouts-Are-Still-Soaring.html?ref=baseball){target="\_blank"} back in 2013. You are tasked to replicate and construct an alternative for it.

[Download the visual](/visuals/Choice4.png)

To get the data, run the following in your script and Rmarkdown document:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(Lahman)
library(Lahman)  
library(dplyr)

# Pipes everwhere!
so_by_team <- select(Teams, yearID, name, G, SO) %>%
               mutate(strikeouts_per_game = SO/G) 

avg_so_by_year  <- so_by_team %>% 
                    group_by(yearID) %>%
                    summarise(avg_so = mean(strikeouts_per_game))

# you can either use both so_by_team & avg_so_by_year,
# or use only so_by_team and look at ?stat_summary
```

# How to Do It:

1.  Open the `Relications_Practice_Script.R` blank R script or simple create one as you normally would. Then get to replicating one of the visualizations given above using the corresponding data set.

2.  After you are happy with your plots, double click and open the file `Replications.rmd`. It should load up into RStudio.

3.  Follow the directions and copy the appropriate parts over. Make sure to compile the document!

4.  Submit the PDF output of the Rmarkdown to [\#wk-5-replications](https://2021edp693e.slack.com/archives/C01NJ8H33V3){target="\_blank"}

You can download all of the scripts to fetch data, `Relications_Practice_Script.R` and `Replications.rmd` by clicking below

```{r echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE}
downloadthis::download_file(
  path = here::here("static", "data", "Week5-ooc-taskfiles.zip"),
  output_name = "Week 5 Task Files",
  button_label = "Download the files",
  button_type = "default",
  has_icon = TRUE,
  icon = "fa fa-save",
  class = "hvr-sweep-to-left"
  )
```

## More about Rmarkdown

Its not a bad idea to see what you can do with an Rmarkdown document. For example, you can actually output a file in nearly any format (e.g. Pages, PDF, HTML, Word, etc.) In fact this course website is written on an Rmarkdown platform called [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/){target="\_blank"}.

## First Timers Note
You'll see class related tasks posted here on a weekly basis. 

### Class Slack Account Access
Most important task of the week - well to me at least - is to

  1. Go to the course [Slack](http://2021edp693e.slack.com){target="_blank"} account 
  2. Register if you already do not have an account. Note that you do not have to use your WVU account, but its not a bad idea.
  
### Find a bad graphic
Find a bad plot in the media or online.   
Submit via eCampus a `.pdf` or `.docx` (Word) document that includes:

  1. A cover page with your name and a title in the upper left hand corner.
  2. A copy of your plot.
  3. Information on the source (a citation or webpage address).  
  4. Short succinct answers to the following questions:
      a. Is it bad because it is misleading, or because it is unclear or both?
      b. How would you improve it?
      c. What rules (from Wainer's paper) does it follow and which principles (Chapter 2 in Tufte) does it violate?
      

Please post a copy of your entire task to the Slack channel [`#week1-class-task`](http://2021edp693e.slack.com/archives/C01K23SKK1D){target="_blank"}.

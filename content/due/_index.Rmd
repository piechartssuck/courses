This section will let you know what must be completed for assessment purposes. You should still do everything else because those items are still expected and you will be scored on those skills eventually on some other course related task.

### Need Help?
I always prefer a face to face meeting if possible but since that's not possible, you can schedule a Zoom via the [Calendar](https://calendly.com/nopiecharts){target="_blank"} or contact me within [Slack](http:/2021edp693e.slack.com){target="_blank"} by tagging my name `@Dr. Abhik Roy` in a text box along with your message.

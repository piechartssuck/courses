For a group of people who love conciseness, evaluators often use tools with some complexity. A few are listed below.

## Checklists

Evaluators love checklists and so much so that there is repository solely dedicated to housing them. Head over to [The Evaluation Center](https://wmich.edu/evaluation/checklists) at Western Michigan University to take a look.

## Logic Models

Logic models are simply a visual(ish) way to depict the moving parts of a program. Once constructed, it is a fairly easy way to guide parts of an evaluation and for stakeholders to see if changes need to occur. The [Program Development and Evaluation](https://fyi.extension.wisc.edu/programdevelopment/logic-models/) supported by the University of Wisconsin Extension Program is a fantastic resource for all things logic model.

## A Whole Bunch of Methods

For better or for worse, being an evaluator is akin to *being a jack of all trades but a master of none.* That is not meant to be demeaning in any way (or else I’d just be putting myself down). They are typically methodologists and/or have an innate ability to construct studies to determine the needs of a program. However evaluators are rarely content experts and even if they are are, the likelihood of evaluating something within our content is pretty low. Take a look at [Better Evaluation](https://www.betterevaluation.org/en) to get an idea of the breadth of methods and approaches evaluators need to know in order to do their job effectively.

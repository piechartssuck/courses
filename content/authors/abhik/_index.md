I hold a Ph.D. in Program Evaluation and am an Assistant Professor of Educational Psychology within the Department of Counseling and Learning Sciences in the College of Education and Human Services at West Virginia University. I currently perform research on the teaching of developmental evaluation, modeling of social science concepts using machine learning, and in the construction of predictive social networks.

<h2>First Things First! Set your Working Directory</h2>
<p>Your <em>working directory</em> is simply where your script will look for anything it needs like external data sets. There are a few ways to go about doing this which we will cover. However for now, just do the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Open up a new script by going to <code>File &gt; New File &gt; R Script</code>.</li>
<li>Save it in a preferably empty folder as whatever you want.</li>
<li>Go to the menu bar and select <code>Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; To Source File Location</code>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="download-the-script" class="section level2">
<h2>Download the script</h2>
<p>Copying and pasting syntax from a browser can cause problems. To avoid this issue, please download a script with all of the needed code presented in this walkthrough.</p>

<h2>Foundational Structures</h2>
<p>Akin to how atoms were viewed as the building blocks of life, these are the basic structures of R.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>vector</em> - The very basic structure of R where one type of information can be stored. These are given by a single row or column of things that have to be the same data type.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nothing_vector &lt;- c()

nothing_vector</code></pre>
<pre><code>## NULL</code></pre>

<li><p><em>object</em> - These are the different ways you can structure your data to do something with it. All objects are made up of one or more vectors.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="data-types" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Types</h2>
<p>There are six types of data that R can read on its own without the help of any other piece of software. These are known as atomic vectors where <em>atomic</em> means the vector only holds data of a single type</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>character: “a”, “swc”</li>
<li>numeric: 2, 15.5</li>
<li>integer: 2L (the L tells R to store this as an integer)</li>

</div>
<div id="classes" class="section level2">
<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>A <em>class</em> is the blueprint that helps to create an object. These are</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>matrix</em> - A two-dimensional object made up of rows and columns. These are essentially a bunch of vectors stacked on top or beside each other that have to be the same data type.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>some_matrix &lt;- matrix(c(1,1,2,3,5,8), nrow = 2, ncol = 3)

## [1,]    1    2    5
## [2,]    1    3    8</code></pre></li>
<li><p><em>array</em> - A three-dimensional object made up of a bunch of matrices that have to be the same data type.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>some_array &lt;- array(1, dim = c(2, 3, 3))

some_array</code></pre>
<pre><code>## , , 1

<pre class="r"><code>some_df &lt;- data.frame(col1 = 1:3, 
                 col2 = c(&quot;take&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;nap&quot;),

<p>Both <code>height</code> and <code>weight</code> are called <em>variables</em> because they have been assigned a bunch of stuff which in this case are integers. Well we have these, might as well do something with them.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>height &lt;- c(145, 167, 176, 123, 150)

<p>Well that wasn’t exciting at all was it? It’ll get interesting soon.</p>
<p>R provides many functions to examine features of vectors and other objects, for example</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>class()</code> - what kind of object is it (high-level)?</li>
<li><code>typeof()</code> - what is the object’s data type (low-level)?</li>
<li><code>length()</code> - how long is it? What about two dimensional objects?</li>
<li><code>attributes()</code> - does it have any metadata? (underlying set of data that describes and gives information about other data)</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>class(weight) # Yup there are numbers so numeric makes sense.</code></pre>

<h1>Data Frames - A Format You Absolutely Want</h1>
<p>We want all of our data to be in this form. A <em>data frame</em> is a table or a two-dimensional array-like structure in which each column contains values of one variable and each row contains one set of values from each column. Characteristics of a data frame are as follows and in no particular order:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The column names should be non-empty.</li>
<li>The row names should be unique.</li>
<li>The data stored in a data frame can be of numeric, factor or character type.</li>
<li>Each column should contain same number of data items.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>NOTE: You can always check if a variable is a data frame by <code>is.data.frame(whatever)</code></em></p>
<div id="importing-and-viewing-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Importing and Viewing Data</h2>
<p>Read in the file <code>USpop2010to2017.csv</code> that has data on US population estimates from 2010 to 2017. You can do this in multiple ways but for now and since you’re getting used to menu. To bring in the file, go to the <code>Environment</code> tab in the upper right window and then <code>Import Dataset &gt; From Text (readr) &gt; Browse</code> to find your file and load it in. Before clicking on the <code>Import</code> button, name the variable <code>population</code> under <code>Import options</code>. You should get an output similar to the one shown below.</p>
<p>But know that we will be moving away from the idea of using a mouse/trackpad to do things because it wastes time and is generally disruptive. Instead we’ll use the file’s <em>relative path</em>, that is the locations of all other files in comparison to your script to bring in data. If the <code>USpop2010to2017.csv</code> data set is in the same folder as your script, then run the following command</p>
<pre class="r"><code>population &lt;- read.csv(&quot;USpop2010to2017.csv&quot;, 
                       header = TRUE, 
                       stringsAsFactors = TRUE) </code></pre>
<p>Now take a look at the file by running</p>

<li>It is a data frame with variables given by <code>$</code>. More about this below.</li>
<li>The first column is a character vector (made up only of strings of text).</li>
<li>The remaining columns are integer vectors (made up only of numbers in the form of integers).</li>
<li>You may be wondering why we skipped over the <code>factors</code> and <code>levels</code>. That’s a bit complicated for this session but we will get to it because they play an important role in visualizing the data.</li>

<p>OK well that’s better but it looks funny - the y-axis looks like the output on a mid 90s calculator that couldn’t handle exponents. So we’re going to divide and round. Since everything is in hundreds of millions in our data set, let’s divide each column by one hundred million but keep the original figures.</p>

<h1>A Bit of Context</h1>
<p>Well what you just went through is the <em>OG</em> R which was released publicly in 1995. While nowadays it is commonly known as <em>Base R</em>, a majority of its functionality, structure and syntax were derived from another piece of software called S-Plus which was a commercial product from 1988 primarily used only by statisticians. Regardless of the name, this would continue to be the case until the 2007 when <a href="%22http://hadley.nz/%22" target="_blank">Hadley Wickham</a> officially released an R add-on, or <em>package</em> called <code>ggplot2</code>. Little did anybody know that this would alter the future of data visualization. Starting next week, we’ll move on from Base R to <code>ggplot</code> and its companion packages known as the <code>tidyverse</code>. If you want to get a preview, click on the image below</p>

<div style="width:180px; height:180px">
<p><a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank"><img src="/img/logos/tidyverse.png" alt="Tidyverse Hex" /></a></p>
</div>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now that’s not to say there isn’t value in knowing Base R. There are many commands that are quick and easy and don’t need add-ons. In fact, some of the syntax has survived the transition to the <em>tidy</em> format we’ll get to next week so for now, back to Base R!</p>

<p>Let’s rename the columns</p>
<pre class="r"><code>users &lt;- facebook$Number.of.users.in.millions
quarter &lt;- facebook$Quarter</code></pre>
<p>We’re going to use the <code>hist()</code> function to plot a basic histogram of the number of users and quarters</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hist(users) </code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-55-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code># Hey its a normal distribution!</code></pre>
<p>We can specify the number of cells for the histogram using the <code>breaks</code> option</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hist(users,
     breaks = 40) </code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-56-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This essentially breaks up the default way that the histogram is constructed. You can also do it within the range of the data set. First to see the minimum and maximum, we use <code>min()</code> and <code>max()</code>, respectively.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>min(users) </code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 100</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>max(users) </code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 2234</code></pre>
<p>So if I wanted to see how this histogram looks say broken into bars of 300, we can do</p>
<pre class="r"><code>(max(users) - min(users))/300</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 7.113333</code></pre>
<p>or better yet if we round up, we’ll get the actual number of bars we need. To always round to the next integer, we can use the <code>ceiling()</code> function</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ceiling((max(users) - min(users))/300)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 8</code></pre>
<p>Now you can count in 300s and get the output you want</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hist(users, 
     breaks = c(100,400,700,1000,1300,1600,1900,2100,2400))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-61-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>but that’s a lot of work and its a bit odd because our data aren’t greater than the the maximum. We can still get the eight bars we want of even width if we let R do it for us using the <code>seq</code>, or sequence option with <code>length.out</code>, or the number of desired bars</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hist(users, 
     breaks = seq(min(users), 
                  max(users),  
                  length.out=8))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-62-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Let’s make it look decent</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hist(users, breaks = seq(min(users), 
                         max(users),   
                         length.out=8), 
     xlab = &quot;Active Users (in millions)&quot;, 
     main = &quot;Facebook utility worldwide as of 2nd quarter 2018&quot;,
     col = c(&quot;#3b5998&quot;,&quot;#6d84b4&quot;, &quot;#afbdd4&quot;, &quot;#d8dfea&quot;, &quot;#ffffff&quot;), 
     border = &quot;#d8dfea&quot;, 
     cex.lab = 1.1) </code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-63-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Notice that you can define colors in a vector and the plot will simply repeat that layout.</p>

<p>Let’s rename the columns</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tweeters &lt;- twitter$Number.of.monthly.active.users.in.millions
season &lt;- twitter$Quarter</code></pre>
<p>Let’s first create a basic plot</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(season, tweeters)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-71-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>There are several types of plot within the plot function which we can access by using the <code>type</code> option</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(season, tweeters,
     type = &quot;l&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-72-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now try options “o”, “p”, and “b” on your own. Check the solutions below to see if your plot rendered correctly</p>
<details>
<summary>
Solutions
</summary>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(season, tweeters,
     type = &quot;o&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-73-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(season, tweeters,
     type = &quot;p&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-74-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(season, tweeters,
     type = &quot;b&quot;)</code></pre>
<img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-75-1.png" width="672" />
</details>
<p>We can also change the line type using the <code>lty</code> option</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(season, tweeters, 
     type = &quot;l&quot;, 
     lty = &quot;dashed&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-76-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(season, tweeters, 
     type = &quot;l&quot;, 
     lty = &quot;dotted&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-77-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Well it looks like the solid line is likely the best so we’ll stick with it.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(season, tweeters,
     type = &quot;l&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-78-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Black and white plots can be great but that’s rarely true for data with ore information than two dimensions.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(season, tweeters,
     type = &quot;l&quot;,
     col = &quot;#5cb85c&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-79-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>You can also use a standard palette in R by using numbers</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(season, tweeters,
     type = &quot;l&quot;,
     col = 3)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-80-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>That line is just too thin. We can make it thicker by using the <code>lwd</code> option</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(season, tweeters,
     col = &quot;#5cb85c&quot;, 
     lwd = 3)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-81-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Finally, we can sort out the axes and plot titles</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(season, tweeters, 
     type = &quot;l&quot;, 
     col = &quot;#5cb85c&quot;, 
     lwd = 3,
     xlab = &quot;Quarter&quot;,
     ylab = &quot;Tweeters (in millions)&quot;,
     main = &quot;Active Users on Twitter&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-82-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>I did promise regression didn’t I? OK well what if we wanted to know the answer to the question: <em>is the Twitter population increasing in size?</em>
Well we can add a basic linear regression to the plot to estimate if that’s true. First let’s calculate the regression line…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fit1 &lt;- lm (tweeters ~ season, 
            data = twitter) 

summary(fit1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##

<p>Let’s load a dataset of Flower characteristics in 3 species of Iris.</p>

<p>There is a lot of data here! Let’s explore using the <code>pairs()</code> function</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pairs(iris)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-85-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This doesn’t tell us much about the species differences. We can tell R to plot using a different color for the three species of iris</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pairs(iris, 
      col = iris$Species)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-86-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Sepal.Length and Petal.Length look interesting! Let’s start by looking at that</p>

     col = iris$Species)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-87-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>These points are difficult to see! Let’s pick some different ones using the <code>pch</code> option</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(iris$Sepal.Length, 
     iris$Petal.Length, 
     col = iris$Species, 
     pch = 15)</code></pre>

<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-89-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p><code>pch</code> 21:25 also specify an edge color (col) and a background color (bg)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(iris$Sepal.Length,

<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-90-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>OK settling on solid circles…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(iris$Sepal.Length,

<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-94-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>f you wish to compare the medians of the boxplot, you can use the function “notch”. If the notches of two plots do not overlap, this is ‘strong evidence’ that the two medians differ.</p>

<p>You may have noticed that the y-axis labels are always orientated to be perpendicular to the axis. We can rotate all axis labels using the <code>las</code> option.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>boxplot(iris$Sepal.Length ~ iris$Species, 
        notch = T,
        las = 1) </code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-96-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now we can add in all the axis and plot labels…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>boxplot(iris$Sepal.Length ~ iris$Species, 
        notch = T,
        las = 1,
        xlab = &quot;Species&quot;, 
        ylab = &quot;Sepal Length&quot;, 
        main = &quot;Sepal Length by Species in Iris&quot;) </code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/02-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-97-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>…and change sizes</p>
<pre class="r"><code>boxplot(iris$Sepal.Length ~ iris$Species, 
        notch = T,
        las = 1,
        xlab = &quot;Species&quot;, 
        ylab = &quot;Sepal Length&quot;, 
        main = &quot;Sepal Length by Species in Iris&quot;,
        cex.lab = 1.5,
        cex.axis = 1.5,
        cex.main = 2) </code></pre>

<p>This section contains extra material to supplement what is covered that week. Sometimes this is just a few links for you to look at and other times its fully annotated R code that you can use as a reference for helping you along with a task. Please access the material on this site this section after you have finished the reading(s).</p>
<p>From time to time, it may also contains video of coding some examples pieces so you can see what it looks like to work with R in real time. You’ll definitely notice that I make all sorts of errors, which <em>is absolutely normal</em> and happens to everyone!</p>

<p>I always prefer a face to face meeting if possible but since that’s not possible, you can schedule a Zoom via the <a href="https://calendly.com/nopiecharts/short30" target="_blank">Calendar</a> or contact me within <a href="http:/2021edp693e.slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a> by tagging my name <code>@Dr. Abhik Roy</code> in a text box along with your message.</p>

<p>This section contains materials to help you understand concepts covered for a given week. Sometimes this just consists of additional information while other times there are R walkthroughs.</p>

<h3>Need Help?</h3>
<p>I always prefer a face to face meeting if possible but since that’s not possible, you can schedule a Zoom via the <a href="https://calendly.com/nopiecharts" target="_blank">Calendar</a> or contact me within <a href="https://2021edp693g.slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a> by tagging my name <code>@Dr. Abhik Roy</code> in a text box along with your message.</p>

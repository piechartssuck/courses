# Crafting a Design: The Framework

Here you select an evaluation model, approach, etc. or develop your own synthesis/integration of others. Ask yourself the following when thinking of your choice

+ **Who** is likely to know what you are interested in?  How can you represent various groups of participants?

+ **What** particular aspects of the program are you interested in (criteria, issues)?  What kinds of data relate to your questions/issues?

+ **Where** do relevant activities occur?  If you can’t directly observe it, where is it reflected?

+ **When** do relevant activities occur?  When should you collect data?

+ **How** can you explore the phenomena in ways that accommodate both your needs and stakeholder needs? Consider your resources and constraints. Be realistic.

# Group Chat Activity Part 1 

Discuss criteria, standards, potential indicators and/or issues you want to have data on for your evaluation.

&gt;- *Start with a brainstorm*. List as many as possible without worrying about whether they are feasible

&gt;- *Prioritize your brainstorm*. Rank those most likely to reveal program quality at the top of the list

&gt;- *Retain your brainstorm*. Keep your list because we will use it later

---

#  Good Questions Are…	 

+ Carefully worded – the wording determines how a participant will respond

+ Open-ended – avoid forcing responses (How satisfied are you… v.s. Describe how you feel about…)

+ Neutral – don’t lead (Describe what makes this program successful v.s. Describe your perceptions of this program.)

+ Singular – avoid “double-loading” (How do you feel about this program and the way it is administered?)

+ Clear – use language your participants use.

+ Relevant to the central issues you want to explore – be parsimonious, value their time.

&lt;/center&gt;

---

#  Good Protocols… 

+ Include questions to elicit descriptive demographic information (age, education, family configuration, relevant experiences, etc.) if necessary and relevant

+ Are thoughtfully ordered
  + Getting to know your participants, their experiences
  + Easing them into the research event
  + Sequencing to build trust in order to elicit their opinions, feelings
  + Sequencing to maintain interest

+ Are of a reasonable length - 8 to 10 substantive questions is often a 45 minute to hour-long interview

+ Remind you of the critical elements you may need to probe for

+ Include a variety of types of questions

+ Close by giving control over the interview to your participants (Is there anything I haven’t asked about that you think I should know?)

#  Making the strange familiar and the familiar strange 

+ Strange to familiar = seeking to understand

+ Familiar to strange = question your own assumptions

+ Staying in long enough to get the insider’s point of view, but not so long that you completely go native

#  Early Days in the Field	 

+ Anxiety is a good thing: Is what you’re doing “right”?

+ Don’t force yourself in – look for easy access.

+ Where are the open places?

+ How can you get into the closed places?

+ Be wary of ordered permission – it isn’t a proper invitation.

+ Follow the contextual schedule – be as unobtrusive as possible.

+ Don’t assume you don’t know anything, but do assume you don’t know everything. Use what you do know to learn more.

#  Taking Running Notes - “Raw” Notes (1/3)

  &lt;source src="audio/datacoll/S23 Running Raw Notes.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"&gt;
  Your browser does not support embedded audio.
&lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

+ Be unobtrusive – situate yourself carefully.

+ With a team divide up the setting.

+ Use a small pad or folded paper to take notes.

+ Practice looking, listening, writing and keeping written lines separate.

+ Detail, detail, detail – not good grammar and sentence structure.

+ Jot down key words to jog your memory later.

+ Keep a card with you or a guide that helps you focus on the things most important in the observation – but note other things, too.

---

#  Taking Running Notes - “Raw” Notes (2/3)

+ Continuous scripting – stopping sends the message “that’s not important” or you’re “looking for something.”

+ Be aware of everything!

+ Attend to figure-ground. Go wide then narrow your focus.

+ Keep track of yourself, your interpretations or reactions in brackets - Evaluator’s awareness of self. Can be judgmental here.

+ Keep track of the time.

+ Use all of your senses.

---

#  Taking Running Notes - “Raw” Notes (3/3)

+ When recording conversations try to capture first, middle and last words.  Listen for key words.  Develop a shorthand. Verbatim quote “   “

+ Close, not exact ‘   ‘

+ Missed something  _____, fill in the blanks ASAP.

+ Quote people all the time!  What was said, how was it said?  If something is said prior to the observation event, include that in your notes.

+ At least summarize what seems to be idle talk.

---

#  ***Cooking*** Your Notes 

+ Begin cooking raw notes ASAP – fill in the blanks before you leave the scene

+ Finish cooking ASAP, preferably immediately after event, but at least the same day– memory fades quickly and multiple observations tend to bleed together

+ Be concrete.  Distinguish verbatim accounts from paraphrasing and general recall.

+ Work at the lowest possible level of inference

---

#  Good ***Cooked*** Notes Include...

+ Mapping (drawn or descriptive) - Capture the physical setting, social arrangements.

+ Descriptive, but not judgmental language.

+ Excruciating, mundane detail.

+ Visualization

+ Sensory experience

+ Presence of self

+ Presence of others

+ Context

+ Figure-ground

+ Notes on notes

---

#  Notes on Notes 

+ Your “hunches” and preliminary analyses - *How will you follow up?*

+ Your subjective feelings - *Why do you feel that way?*

+ Contrary analysis - *Are you being biased or avoiding certain questions?*

+ Clearly bracket these so you know what is true field notes vs. what is notes on notes.

#  Finding Documents 

+ Begin with the public – work toward the private. Gaining access to documents follows the same path as establishing rapport with participants – the deeper the rapport, the more private documents you’ll have access to.

+ Rely on your guiding questions / issues, questions that emerge during data collection and data analysis, and your “hunches” to make decisions about what to look for and what to analyze.

#  Types of Documents 

+ *Public records* - publicity materials, board meeting minutes, evaluation reports, etc.

+ *Program generated internal* - memos, email correspondence, training manuals, time cards, performance logs, etc.

+ *Personal documents* -  journals, scrapbooks, photos, letters, etc.

+ *Physical materials* -  equipment, tools, records of the results of actual behavior

#  Why Conduct Document Analysis? 

*Triangulation* - Primary source information about goals, performances, contexts, etc..

*Proxy for non-observables* – History, private behavior / interactions… you can’t be there all the time.

*Mulling* - To stimulate thinking about important questions / issues to pursue through more direct observations and interviewing.

#  Limitations 

+ Information may be incomplete or may not line up neatly with your evaluation questions and issues.

+ Sampling may be unrepresentative – documents produced by one group may not be produced by another group.

+ May be difficult to establish authenticity, accuracy, biases.

---

# Establishing the Provenance (1/2)

+ Ask about the history of the document – when was it produced, where has it been archived?

+ Consider how you obtained the document – who gave it to you, why did they give it to you?

+ Is the document legitimate, authentic, accurate?

+ What are the circumstances of the document’s production – why was it produced, who produced it, when was it produced (historical context)?

---

# Establishing the Provenance (2/2)

+ What informed the document’s production – a firsthand account, a secondhand account, a reconstruction, an interpretation

+ Consider possible biases and their impact on the document

+ Are there other documents that may help you verify the legitimacy, authenticity or accuracy of the document?

---

#  Collecting Quantitative Data Review

---

#  Group Chat Activity Part 2 

+ Return to your prioritized list of criteria and/or issues for your class project.

  &gt;- For several items near the top, discuss what existing data there is that you are aware of AND specific ways you might collect data
  
  &gt;- Think about how far down the list you might feasibly go for your course project
